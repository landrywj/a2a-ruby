# Code Review Workflow
# This workflow automatically requests Codex code reviews for pull requests targeting the main branch.
#
# Setup required:
# 1. Codex must be configured for your repository (see https://a2a-protocol.org for details)
# 2. The workflow will automatically post a comment requesting a Codex review
#
# The review will:
# - Trigger Codex's built-in GitHub integration
# - Review all code changes in the PR
# - Post review comments directly on the PR
